# Wordpot

Wordpot is a Wordpress honeypot which detects probes for plugins, themes, timthumb and other common files used to fingerprint a wordpress installation.
   
    $ python wordpot.py --help
    Usage: wordpot.py [options]
    
    Options:
      -h, --help        show this help message and exit
      --host=HOST       Host address
      --port=PORT       Port address
      --title=TITLE     Blog Title

      --plugins=PLUGINS Fake installed plugins
      --themes=THEMES   Fake installed plugins
      --ver=VERSION     Wordpress version

To configure the honeypot you can edit the config file `wordpot.conf` or provide arguments trough the command line interface as shown above.

## Docker Instructions

To build and run this withing docker, follow these commands. Use the -p option to expose a port from the inside:outside.

```
docker build -t wordport .
docker run -p 80:80 wordpot
```

## Theme support

You can use a wordpress theme as you would in a normal Wordpress installation by putting the theme folder in the `static/wp-content/themes/` directory. You might also need to edit the html skeleton which is stored in the `templates/` folder and should be named as your theme (e.g. `themename.html`) - take a look at `twentyeleven.html` to see how it works. 

To use the theme start wordpot with the theme option (default value is `twentyeleven`):
    
    $ python wordpot --theme=THEMENAME

Templates are built with the [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org) template engine.

## Expandable with plugins (*beta*)

Wordpot can be expanded with plugins to improve its behaviour or just expand some functionalities.

For example you can write a plugin to mimick a particular vulnerability in a Wordpress plugin or theme.
